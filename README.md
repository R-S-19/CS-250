# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are very important for anyone who is part of a Scrum team, from the Scrum Master to the developers. Implementing user needs can be done by actively listening to what they need to say and what they want to achieve with their product. Creating "user stories" helps with this because "user stories" describes in details the features that the user wants and what they are needed for. Creating an "user story" helps understand better the point of view of the user.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would approach a developing program with curiosity and understanding of the project management strategy that I could incorporate into it. The agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future development work is the daily standup meeting. This meeting in the team is extremely important because open a line of communication and trust amongst everyone, therefore this is something that I would always like to implement.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
